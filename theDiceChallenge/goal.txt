The goal of the project is to create a website with a dice game of two players (Player 1 and 2);
the website will start with a refresh me state and tell the user to refresh the website to (roll the dice)... 
when the website refreshes the dice is rolled at a random and the outcome is displayed with the winner indicated as the player with the highest dice number

First, we have to get 6 dice images from 1 - 6
